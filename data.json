        "title": "Building a 100% Serverless Blog Site Application with the Right Observability and Security",
        "description": "In the workshop, at first, we will build blog post handling and processing parts of a blog site application from scratch step by step on AWS Lambda. Applications will be interacted and pipelined with each other through AWS services like API Gateway, SQS, SNS, DynamoDB and many others. We will discuss the best practices for debugging a serverless application written in Node.js while developing the application. Then, we will grasp the importance of observability in distributed serverless applications and learn how to monitor this application s with CloudWatch, X-Ray, and Thundra. Finally, we will talk about potential security threats for a serverless application and how to address those with least privileged IAM permissions and Thundra’s built-in security. <br/>Take-aways: <br/>* Understanding the internals and capabilities of AWS components in a serverless architecture. <br/>* Discovering different ways of debugging a serverless application <br/>* Understanding of why observability is crucial for your application <br/>* The ways of gaining observability with cloud provided solutions and with Thundra <br/>* Understanding common security pitfalls in serverless applications and potential solutions to these.",

        "title": "The Difficult Second Album",
        "description": "In 2019 the team behind LEGO.com delivered the engineering equivalent of the world-beating breakthrough debut album - moving in just over a year from an inflexible and monolithic on-premise commerce architecture to the brave new world of headless, serverless commerce running fully in the public cloud - with fantastic results for the LEGO Group. <br/>Now in 2020 we stand with the Difficult Second Album ahead of us. How do we beat - in fact how do we even match - the killer debut? How do we make sure our second opus is less like The Stone Roses’ ‘The Second Coming’ and more like Nirvana’s ‘Nevermind’?<br/>In this talk, Simon Young - Director of Software Engineering & Architecture at The LEGO Group - will take you through the key success factors of the LEGO.com engineering transformation to date, look at the challenges of running a serverless-based platform at scale and consider how to maintain that architectural flexibility as the serverless landscape continues to evolve and the product and the teams responsible for the product scale to meet ever-increasing expectations.",
